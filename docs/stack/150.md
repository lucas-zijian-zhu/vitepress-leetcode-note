# [150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

You are given an array of strings <code>tokens</code> that represents an arithmetic expression in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation" target="_blank">Reverse Polish Notation</a>.

Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the expression.

**Note**  that:

- The valid operators are <code>'+'</code>, <code>'-'</code>, <code>'*'</code>, and <code>'/'</code>.
- Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
- The division between two integers always **truncates toward zero** .
- There will not be any division by zero.
- The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
- The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a **32-bit**  integer.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]
Output: 9
Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]
Output: 6
Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6
```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]
Output: 22
Explanation: ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
= (0 + 17) + 5
= 17 + 5
= 22
```

**Constraints:** 

- <code>1 <= tokens.length <= 10^4</code>
- <code>tokens[i]</code> is either an operator: <code>"+"</code>, <code>"-"</code>, <code>"*"</code>, or <code>"/"</code>, or an integer in the range <code>[-200, 200]</code>.

## Approach

We can use a **stack** to solve this problem:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate through each token in `tokens`:
   - If the token is a **number**, push it onto the stack.
   - If the token is an **operator** (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`):
     - Pop the top two numbers from the stack (second operand first, then first operand).
     - Apply the operation and push the result back onto the stack.
3. After processing all tokens, the stack will have exactly one element, which is the result.

## Kotlin Code

```kotlin
fun evalRPN(tokens: Array<String>): Int {
    val stack = mutableListOf<Int>()
    
    for (token in tokens) {
        when (token) {
            "+" -> {
                val b = stack.removeAt(stack.size - 1)
                val a = stack.removeAt(stack.size - 1)
                stack.add(a + b)
            }
            "-" -> {
                val b = stack.removeAt(stack.size - 1)
                val a = stack.removeAt(stack.size - 1)
                stack.add(a - b)
            }
            "*" -> {
                val b = stack.removeAt(stack.size - 1)
                val a = stack.removeAt(stack.size - 1)
                stack.add(a * b)
            }
            "/" -> {
                val b = stack.removeAt(stack.size - 1)
                val a = stack.removeAt(stack.size - 1)
                stack.add(a / b)
            }
            else -> stack.add(token.toInt())
        }
    }
    
    return stack[0]
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of tokens. Each token is processed once.  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, for the stack to hold intermediate numbers.
