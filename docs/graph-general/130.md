# [130. Surrounded Regions](https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)<Badge type="warning" text="Medium" />

You are given an <code>m x n</code> matrix <code>board</code> containing **letters**  <code>'X'</code> and <code>'O'</code>, **capture regions**  that are **surrounded** :

- **Connect** : A cell is connected to adjacent cells horizontally or vertically.
- **Region** : To form a region **connect every**  <code>'O'</code> cell.
- **Surround** : The region is surrounded with <code>'X'</code> cells if you can **connect the region ** with <code>'X'</code> cells and none of the region cells are on the edge of the <code>board</code>.

To capture a **surrounded region** , replace all <code>'O'</code>s with <code>'X'</code>s **in-place**  within the original board. You do not need to return anything.

**Example 1:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/xogrid.jpg" style="width: 367px; height: 158px;">

```
Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Explanation: The bottom region is not captured because it is on the edge of the board and cannot be surrounded.
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: board = [["X"]]
Output: [["X"]]
```

**Constraints:** 

- <code>m == board.length</code>
- <code>n == board[i].length</code>
- <code>1 <= m, n <= 200</code>
- <code>board[i][j]</code> is <code>'X'</code> or <code>'O'</code>.

## ðŸ’¡ Approach: DFS from Boundaries

### Intuition

The key insight is that **only 'O's connected to the boundary can survive**. All other 'O's are surrounded and should be captured. We can use a two-step approach:

1. **Mark boundary-connected 'O's** as temporary markers (e.g., 'T')
2. **Replace remaining 'O's** with 'X' and restore 'T's to 'O'

### Algorithm

1. **Find boundary 'O's** and mark them as 'T' using DFS
2. **Replace all remaining 'O's** with 'X' (these are surrounded)
3. **Restore all 'T's** back to 'O' (these are boundary-connected)

### Key Points

- Only boundary-connected 'O's survive
- Use temporary marker to distinguish boundary 'O's
- DFS from all boundary positions
- Two-pass approach: mark then replace

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(m Ã— n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. We visit each cell at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m Ã— n) in the worst case for the recursion stack (if the entire boundary is filled with 'O's).
