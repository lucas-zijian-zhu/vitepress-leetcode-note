# [133. Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150) <Badge type="warning" text="Medium" />

Given a reference of a node in a **<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)#Connected_graph" target="_blank">connected</a>**  undirected graph.

Return a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy" target="_blank">**deep copy** </a> (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (<code>int</code>) and a list (<code>List[Node]</code>) of its neighbors.

```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```

**Test case format:** 

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with <code>val == 1</code>, the second node with <code>val == 2</code>, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

<b>An adjacency list</b> is a collection of unordered <b>lists</b> used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with <code>val = 1</code>. You must return the **copy of the given node**  as a reference to the cloned graph.

**Example 1:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/04/133_clone_graph_question.png" style="width: 454px; height: 500px;">

```
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
```

**Example 2:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph.png" style="width: 163px; height: 148px;">

```
Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: adjList = []
Output: []
Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
```

**Constraints:** 

- The number of nodes in the graph is in the range <code>[0, 100]</code>.
- <code>1 <= Node.val <= 100</code>
- <code>Node.val</code> is unique for each node.
- There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
- The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

## 💡 Approach: DFS with HashMap

### Intuition

To clone a graph, we need to create a copy of each node and maintain the same neighbor relationships. The key challenge is handling cycles in the graph. We use a **HashMap** to track visited nodes and their clones.

### Algorithm

1. **Use HashMap** to store mapping from original node to cloned node
2. **Use DFS** to traverse the graph
3. **For each node**:
   - If already cloned, return the clone from HashMap
   - Otherwise, create a new clone
   - Recursively clone all neighbors
   - Add neighbors to the cloned node

### Key Points

- Use HashMap to avoid infinite loops (handle cycles)
- DFS or BFS both work
- Deep copy means copying structure and values
- Handle null input edge case

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n + m), where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges. We visit each node and edge once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for the HashMap to store all cloned nodes and O(h) for the recursion stack where h is the depth of the graph.
