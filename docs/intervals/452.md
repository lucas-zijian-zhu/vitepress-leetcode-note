# [452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)<Badge type="warning" text="Medium" />

There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array <code>points</code> where <code>points[i] = [x<sub>start</sub>, x<sub>end</sub>]</code> denotes a balloon whose **horizontal diameter**  stretches between <code>x<sub>start</sub></code> and <code>x<sub>end</sub></code>. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up **directly vertically**  (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with <code>x<sub>start</sub></code> and <code>x<sub>end</sub></code> is **burst**  by an arrow shot at <code>x</code> if <code>x<sub>start</sub> <= x <= x<sub>end</sub></code>. There is **no limit**  to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array <code>points</code>, return the **minimum**  number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.
```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].
```

**Constraints:** 

- <code>1 <= points.length <= 10^5</code>
- <code>points[i].length == 2</code>
- <code>-2^31 <= x<sub>start</sub> < x<sub>end</sub> <= 2^31 - 1</code>

## Approach

This is an interval covering greedy problem. Each arrow is shot vertically at some x and bursts all intervals that contain x. To minimize the number of arrows, we want each arrow to cover as many intervals as possible.

Algorithm:

- Sort the intervals by their right endpoint (x_end) in ascending order.
- Maintain the current arrow position curEnd as the right endpoint of the last chosen interval (initialize to the first interval's right endpoint). Iterate the remaining intervals:
  - If the current interval's left endpoint x_start <= curEnd, the current arrow can burst it (no new arrow needed).
  - Otherwise, shoot a new arrow (increment count) and set curEnd to this interval's right endpoint.

Choosing the earliest finishing interval's right endpoint is optimal because it maximizes overlap with subsequent intervals.

Edge cases: if points is empty return 0; if only one interval return 1.

## Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting n intervals; the sweep is O(n).
- Space complexity: O(1) extra space (not counting input); sorting may use O(n) temporary space depending on the implementation.
