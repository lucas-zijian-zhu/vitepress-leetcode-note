# [123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

You are given an array <code>prices</code> where <code>prices[i]</code> is the price of a given stock on the <code>i^th</code> day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete **at most two transactions** .

**Note:**  You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

**Constraints:** 

- <code>1 <= prices.length <= 10^5</code>
- <code>0 <= prices[i] <= 10^5</code>

## üöÄ Approach
This is an extension of the single transaction problem (LeetCode 121).  
We want to maximize the profit from **at most two transactions**.  
We can track 4 states:
- `buy1`: The maximum cash you have after buying the first stock (minimize the cost).
- `sell1`: The maximum cash you have after selling the first stock.
- `buy2`: The maximum cash you have after buying the second stock (considering the profit from the first transaction).
- `sell2`: The maximum cash you have after selling the second stock.

For each price:
- `buy1 = max(buy1, -price)`
- `sell1 = max(sell1, buy1 + price)`
- `buy2 = max(buy2, sell1 - price)`
- `sell2 = max(sell2, buy2 + price)`

We initialize `buy1` and `buy2` to negative infinity and `sell1` and `sell2` to 0.  
At the end, `sell2` contains the maximum profit with at most two transactions.
