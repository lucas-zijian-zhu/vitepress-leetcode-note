# [117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node-ii/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Given a binary tree

```
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
```

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to <code>NULL</code>.

Initially, all next pointers are set to <code>NULL</code>.

**Example 1:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/15/117_sample.png" style="width: 500px; height: 171px;">

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,7,#]
Explanation: Given the above binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

**Constraints:** 

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[0, 6000]</code>.
- <code>-100 <= Node.val <= 100</code>

**Follow-up:** 

- You may only use constant extra space.
- The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

## ðŸ’¡ Approach: Level-by-Level with Previous Node

### Intuition

This is similar to LeetCode 116, but the tree is not necessarily complete. We need to connect each node to its next right node at the same level. The key insight is to use the already established next pointers to traverse the current level while building the next level.

### Algorithm

1. **Use a dummy head** to simplify the logic for the first node in each level
2. **Traverse level by level**:
   - Start from the root
   - For each level, use a `prev` pointer to track the previous node
   - Connect each node to the next node in the same level
3. **Handle missing children**: Skip null children and only process actual nodes
4. **Move to next level**: Use the next pointers to move to the next level

### Key Points

- Use `dummy.next` to get the first node of the next level
- Use `prev` to track the previous node for connecting
- Reset `dummy.next` and `prev` for each new level

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes. We visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), using only constant extra space (the dummy node and prev pointer).
