# [392. Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Given two strings <code>s</code> and <code>t</code>, return <code>true</code> if <code>s</code> is a **subsequence**  of <code>t</code>, or <code>false</code> otherwise.

A **subsequence**  of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., <code>"ace"</code> is a subsequence of <code>"abcde"</code> while <code>"aec"</code> is not).

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```

**Constraints:** 

- <code>0 <= s.length <= 100</code>
- <code>0 <= t.length <= 10^4</code>
- <code>s</code> and <code>t</code> consist only of lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:**  Suppose there are lots of incoming <code>s</code>, say <code>s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>, ..., s<sub>k</sub></code> where <code>k >= 10^9</code>, and you want to check one by one to see if <code>t</code> has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

### 💡 Approach

We use a two-pointer technique:

- Pointer `i` for string `s`
- Pointer `j` for string `t`
- Traverse `t`, whenever `s[i] == t[j]`, move `i` forward.
- Always move `j` forward.
- If we reach the end of `s`, that means all characters were found in order in `t`.

Edge case:
- If `s` is an empty string, return `true`.

### ✅ Kotlin Code

```kotlin
class Solution {
    fun isSubsequence(s: String, t: String): Boolean {
        var i = 0
        var j = 0
        while (i < s.length && j < t.length) {
            if (s[i] == t[j]) {
                i++
            }
            j++
        }
        return i == s.length
    }
}
```

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)  
  - Where `n` is the length of string `t`.
  - We traverse `t` at most once with a single pass.

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)  
  - No extra space is used aside from a few integer pointers.
