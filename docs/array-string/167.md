# [167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Given a **1-indexed**  array of integers <code>numbers</code> that is already **sorted in non-decreasing order** , find two numbers such that they add up to a specific <code>target</code> number. Let these two numbers be <code>numbers[index<sub>1</sub>]</code> and <code>numbers[index<sub>2</sub>]</code> where <code>1 <= index<sub>1</sub> < index<sub>2</sub> <= numbers.length</code>.

Return the indices of the two numbers, <code>index<sub>1</sub></code> and <code>index<sub>2</sub></code>, **added by one**  as an integer array <code>[index<sub>1</sub>, index<sub>2</sub>]</code> of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution** . You **may not**  use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index<sub>1</sub> = 1, index<sub>2</sub> = 2. We return [1, 2].
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index<sub>1</sub> = 1, index<sub>2</sub> = 3. We return [1, 3].
```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index<sub>1</sub> = 1, index<sub>2</sub> = 2. We return [1, 2].
```

**Constraints:** 

- <code>2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 10^4</code>
- <code>-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000</code>
- <code>numbers</code> is sorted in **non-decreasing order** .
- <code>-1000 <= target <= 1000</code>
- The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution** .

##  Approach

Given that the input array is **sorted in non-decreasing order**, we can use the **two-pointer technique**:

1. Initialize two pointers:
   - `left` at the beginning (index 0)
   - `right` at the end (index n - 1)

2. Compute the sum of elements at `left` and `right`:
   - If the sum is equal to the target, return their (1-based) indices.
   - If the sum is less than the target, move `left` forward.
   - If the sum is greater than the target, move `right` backward.

This approach works efficiently due to the sorted nature of the array.

## ✅ Kotlin Code

```kotlin
class Solution {
    fun twoSum(numbers: IntArray, target: Int): IntArray {
        var left = 0
        var right = numbers.size - 1

        while (left < right) {
            val sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
            when {
                sum == target -> return intArrayOf(left + 1, right + 1)
                sum < target -> left++
                else -> right--
            }
        }

        return intArrayOf() // Should not reach here as per problem guarantees
    }
}
```

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)  
  We use a two-pointer approach that makes a single pass through the array.  
  Each element is visited at most once, so the total runtime is linear.

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)  
  The algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space (two pointers and a return array of size 2).
