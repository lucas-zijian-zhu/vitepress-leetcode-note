# [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

You are given an array <code>prices</code> where <code>prices[i]</code> is the price of a given stock on the <code>i^th</code> day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day**  to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future**  to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return <code>0</code>.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

**Constraints:** 

- <code>1 <= prices.length <= 10^5</code>
- <code>0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4</code>

## 🚀 Approach
- Iterate through the array from left to right.
- Keep track of the smallest price seen so far: `minPrice`.
- At each step, calculate the profit if you sold today: `price - minPrice`.
- Keep track of the maximum profit: `maxProfit`.


## ✅ Kotlin Code
```kotlin
fun maxProfit(prices: IntArray): Int {
    var minPrice = Int.MAX_VALUE
    var maxProfit = 0

    for (price in prices) {
        if (price < minPrice) {
            minPrice = price
        } else if (price - minPrice > maxProfit) {
            maxProfit = price - minPrice
        }
    }

    return maxProfit
}
```
