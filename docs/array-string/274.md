# [274. H-Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Given an array of integers <code>citations</code> where <code>citations[i]</code> is the number of citations a researcher received for their <code>i^th</code> paper, return the researcher's h-index.

According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index" target="_blank">definition of h-index on Wikipedia</a>: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of <code>h</code> such that the given researcher has published at least <code>h</code> papers that have each been cited at least <code>h</code> times.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: citations = [1,3,1]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:** 

- <code>n == citations.length</code>
- <code>1 <= n <= 5000</code>
- <code>0 <= citations[i] <= 1000</code>

## üìù Approach

We want to find the largest integer `h` such that there are at least `h` papers with **at least** `h` citations each.  
We can use a **bucket sort idea**, because citation counts beyond `n` (the number of papers) can all go into the same bucket at `n`.

### Steps:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Create an array `buckets` of size `n+1`, where `buckets[i]` counts the number of papers with exactly `i` citations.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Iterate through `citations`, and increment `buckets[min(citation, n)]`.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Iterate from `n` down to `0`, summing up the counts of papers.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ When the cumulative count ‚â• `i`, return `i` as the H-Index.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ If no such `i` is found, return `0`.

This avoids sorting the array and runs in **O(n)** time and space.

    fun hIndex(citations: IntArray): Int {
        val n = citations.size

        for (c in citations) {
            buckets[minOf(c, n)]++
        }

        for (i in n downTo 0) {
            total += buckets[i]
            if (total >= i) return i
        }

        return 0
    }

    const n = citations.length;
    const buckets = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);

    for (const c of citations) {

        total += buckets[i];
        if (total >= i) return i;

```java [Java]

        int n = citations.length;
        int[] buckets = new int[n + 1];

            if (total >= i) return i;
        }

        return 0;

```python [Python]
class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(citations)
        buckets = [0] * (n + 1)

        for c in citations:
            buckets[min(c, n)] += 1

        total = 0
        for i in range(n, -1, -1):
            total += buckets[i]

| Type                | Complexity |
|---------------------|------------|
| ‚è≥ **Time Complexity** | O(n)       |
| üóÇÔ∏è **Space Complexity** | O(n)       |

- We iterate through the citations array once: **O(n)**
- We iterate through the buckets once: **O(n)**
- We use an auxiliary array of size **n+1**: **O(n)**
