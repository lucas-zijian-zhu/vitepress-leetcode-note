# [135. Candy](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

There are <code>n</code> children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array <code>ratings</code>.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

**Constraints:** 

- <code>n == ratings.length</code>
- <code>1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4</code>
- <code>0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 10^4</code>

## 📋 Approach

We need to distribute candies to children standing in a line such that:
- Each child gets at least 1 candy.
- If a child has a higher rating than their immediate neighbor, they get more candies than that neighbor.

### Key Idea:
✅ Use a **greedy two-pass scan** because each child needs to satisfy constraints with both their left and right neighbors.  
✅ The constraints from the left and right are **independent**, so we can solve them separately and take the maximum of both.

### Steps:
1️⃣ Initialize an array `candies` with all elements set to `1`.  
2️⃣ Left-to-right pass:
   - If `ratings[i] > ratings[i-1]`, set `candies[i] = candies[i-1] + 1`.
3️⃣ Right-to-left pass:
   - If `ratings[i] > ratings[i+1]`, set `candies[i] = max(candies[i], candies[i+1] + 1)`.
4️⃣ Sum up all values in `candies` as the result.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  \(O(n)\) — We iterate over the array twice (left-to-right and right-to-left), each in linear time.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  \(O(n)\) — We use an auxiliary array `candies` of size \(n\) to store the candy counts.
