# [122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150) <Badge type="warning" text="Medium" />

You are given an integer array <code>prices</code> where <code>prices[i]</code> is the price of a given stock on the <code>i^th</code> day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one**  share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the **same day** .

Find and return the **maximum**  profit you can achieve.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.
```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
```

**Constraints:** 

- <code>1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10^4</code>
- <code>0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4</code>

## 🚀 Approach
- Since you can perform unlimited transactions, you can capture **every upward price movement**.
- Iterate through the array.
- If the current day's price is higher than the previous day's, you add the difference to your profit.
- This is equivalent to buying at each local minima and selling at each local maxima, but we can simplify by summing up all positive differences.
