# [134. Gas Station](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150) <Badge type="warning" text="Medium" />

There are <code>n</code> gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the <code>i^th</code> station is <code>gas[i]</code>.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs <code>cost[i]</code> of gas to travel from the <code>i^th</code> station to its next <code>(i + 1)^th</code> station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays <code>gas</code> and <code>cost</code>, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return <code>-1</code>. If there exists a solution, it is **guaranteed**  to be **unique** .

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
```

**Constraints:** 

- <code>n == gas.length == cost.length</code>
- <code>1 <= n <= 10^5</code>
- <code>0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 10^4</code>
- The input is generated such that the answer is unique.

## 📋 Approach

- If the total amount of gas in the circle is less than the total cost, there is no solution. Return `-1`.
- Otherwise, iterate through the array once:
  - Assume the starting point is `0`.
  - Use `tank` to keep track of the remaining gas from the current `start` to the current position.
  - If at some position `tank < 0`, it means we cannot reach this point starting from `start`.  
    So update `start` to the next station (`i+1`) and reset `tank = 0`.
- After finishing the loop:
  - If the total gas ≥ total cost, the final `start` is the answer.
  - Otherwise, return `-1`.

## ⏱️ Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  O(n) — We iterate through the `gas` and `cost` arrays exactly once.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  O(1) — Only a few integer variables are used; no extra data structures.
