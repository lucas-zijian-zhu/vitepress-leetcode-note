# [36. Valid Sudoku](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Determine if a<code>9 x 9</code> Sudoku boardis valid.Only the filled cells need to be validated**according to the following rules** :

- Each rowmust contain thedigits<code>1-9</code> without repetition.
- Each column must contain the digits<code>1-9</code>without repetition.
- Each of the nine<code>3 x 3</code> sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits<code>1-9</code>without repetition.

**Note:** 

- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentionedrules.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the **5**  in the top left corner being modified to **8** . Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
```

**Constraints:** 

- <code>board.length == 9</code>
- <code>board[i].length == 9</code>
- <code>board[i][j]</code> is a digit <code>1-9</code> or <code>'.'</code>.

## Approach

We can validate the Sudoku board using a **HashSet** to track whether a number has already appeared in its row, column, or 3×3 sub-box.

1. **Iterate through each cell `(i, j)`** in the 9×9 board.
2. **Skip empty cells** denoted by `'.'`.
3. **For each number `num`:**
   - Check if it already exists in:
     1. Row `i`
     2. Column `j`
     3. 3×3 sub-box `(i / 3, j / 3)`
4. **Encode the check as strings** and store in a single HashSet:
   - `"num in row i"`
   - `"num in col j"`
   - `"num in box i/3-j/3"`
5. **If any insertion fails** (duplicate found), return `false`.
6. **If the whole board is scanned** without conflict, return `true`.

## Kotlin Code

```kotlin
class Solution {
    fun isValidSudoku(board: Array<CharArray>): Boolean {
        val seen = HashSet<String>()
        for (i in 0..8) {
            for (j in 0..8) {
                val num = board[i][j]
                if (num == '.') continue
                if (!seen.add("$num in row $i") ||
                    !seen.add("$num in col $j") ||
                    !seen.add("$num in box ${i/3}-${j/3}")) {
                    return false
                }
            }
        }
        return true
    }
}
```

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(1)` → 81 cells fixed for 9x9 board  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` → At most 81×3 entries in HashSet
