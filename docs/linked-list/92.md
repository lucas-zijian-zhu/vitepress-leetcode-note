# [92. Reverse Linked List II](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Given the <code>head</code> of a singly linked list and two integers <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> where <code>left <= right</code>, reverse the nodes of the list from position <code>left</code> to position <code>right</code>, and return the reversed list.

**Example 1:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev2ex2.jpg" style="width: 542px; height: 222px;">

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: head = [5], left = 1, right = 1
Output: [5]
```

**Constraints:** 

- The number of nodes in the list is <code>n</code>.
- <code>1 <= n <= 500</code>
- <code>-500 <= Node.val <= 500</code>
- <code>1 <= left <= right <= n</code>

**Follow up:**  Could you do it in one pass?

## Approach
1. Use a dummy node pointing to the head to handle edge cases (e.g., reversing from position 1).  
2. Traverse to the node before `left` (call it `prev`).  
3. Reverse the sublist between `left` and `right`:  
   - Use the standard linked list reversal approach by adjusting pointers.  
   - Keep track of the reversed portion and the tail.  
4. Connect the reversed sublist back:  
   - `prev.next` should point to the new head of the reversed sublist.  
   - The tail of the reversed sublist should connect to the node after `right`.  
5. Return `dummy.next` as the new head.

## Kotlin Code
```kotlin
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode(var `val`: Int) {
 *     var next: ListNode? = null
 * }
 */

class Solution {
    fun reverseBetween(head: ListNode?, left: Int, right: Int): ListNode? {
        if (head == null || left == right) return head

        val dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        var prev: ListNode? = dummy

        // Step 1: move prev to the node before `left`
        for (i in 1 until left) {
            prev = prev?.next
        }

        // Step 2: reverse sublist from left to right
        val start = prev?.next       // the first node of sublist
        var then = start?.next       // the node to be moved

        for (i in 0 until right - left) {
            start?.next = then?.next
            then?.next = prev?.next
            prev?.next = then
            then = start?.next
        }

        return dummy.next
    }
}
```

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
  We traverse the list once to reach the left boundary, once more to reverse the sublist, and reconnect nodes in constant time.  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
  We only use a few pointers for manipulation.
