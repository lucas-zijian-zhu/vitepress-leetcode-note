# [162. Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)<Badge type="warning" text="Medium" />

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array <code>nums</code>, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

You may imagine that <code>nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž</code>. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in <code>O(log n)</code> time.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
```

**Constraints:** 

- <code>1 <= nums.length <= 1000</code>
- <code>-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1</code>
- <code>nums[i] != nums[i + 1]</code> for all valid <code>i</code>.

## ðŸ’¡ Approach: Binary Search for Peak

### Intuition

Since we need O(log n) time complexity, we must use binary search. The key insight is that we can always find a peak by moving towards the "uphill" direction.

**Key Observations:**
1. Array boundaries are considered as -âˆž
2. Adjacent elements are never equal
3. We only need to find **any** peak, not necessarily the global maximum

### Algorithm

1. **Initialize pointers:** `left = 0`, `right = nums.length - 1`
2. **Binary search loop:**
   - Calculate `mid = (left + right) / 2`
   - Compare `nums[mid]` with `nums[mid + 1]`:
     - If `nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]`: peak is on the right side, move `left = mid + 1`
     - If `nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]`: peak is on the left side or current element, move `right = mid`
3. **When `left == right`:** we found a peak at index `left`

### Key Points

- Always move towards the "uphill" direction
- Boundary elements are treated as -âˆž
- No need to check both neighbors, only compare with right neighbor
- Loop condition is `left < right` (not `left <= right`)

- **Time Complexity:** O(log n), binary search reduces search space by half each iteration
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), constant extra space used
